The ArcGIS API for JavaScript's widgets have a clean separation between the user interface (the "view") and the underlying business logic ("viewModel"), allowing developers to use the viewModel to create a custom experience. In this session, you will learn how you can create your own view with a custom look at feel using widget viewModels. We will look at examples of how to use the viewModels to create UIs that integrate into popular web frameworks, CSS libraries, as well as the Calcite Design System using web components.
